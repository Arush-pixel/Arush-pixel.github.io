            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated student with a passion for robotics and technology. Outside the classroom, I am an active athlete with a love for soccer and pickleball, which fuel my competitive spirit and teamwork skills.</p>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between engineering and storytelling by pursuing a career in the movie industry, where I hope to apply my technical background to cinematic innovation.</p>
            <p>I am 12 years old and live in Mountain View. I go to Blach Intermediate School.</p>
